# Merge "Today" + "Salesman App" → One Salesman Workspace (Design Review)

**Status:** Final recommendation — **APPROVED direction, awaiting go-ahead to implement.** Reuse-first, flag-gated, reversible.
**Decision (confirmed):** **`/today` is the single canonical salesman workspace; `/field/van-sales` redirects into it.** One operational home, not two interconnected homes.
**Goal:** One salesman workspace · one customer journey · one operational workflow · no duplicate entry points · the salesman never thinks about "modules".

---

## 1. Current overlap analysis (grounded)

There are **two competing "day home" surfaces** for the salesman, and they link to
each other in a circle:

| Surface | File | Role | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Today** | `src/app/(app)/today/page.tsx` (`/today`) | Field "home" for reps + field managers | *Start Journey* CTA → `/field/journey`; coverage / overdue / attention stats; attention list; **quick-nav that links OUT to `/field/van-sales`, `/customers`, `/sales/invoices`, `/attention`, `/inventory`** |
| **Salesman App** ("My Day" hub) | `src/app/(app)/field/van-sales/page.tsx` (`/field/van-sales`) | The van-sales operational shell | Day status (not_started / open / closed); **Start Day → links BACK to `/today`**; *End Day & Settle* → `/field/van-reconciliation`; operational tiles (Customer picker, Journey, Route, Sell, Return, Collect, Van Stock, Reconcile, Merchandising, Offline); reopen inbox; readiness |

**The concrete problems:**

1. **Two homes, circular links.** `/today` → (quick-nav) → `/field/van-sales`; `/field/van-sales` → (Start Day) → `/today`. The rep bounces between two "start of day" screens and never has a single obvious home.
2. **Duplicate / divergent destinations for the same task:**
   - *Customers:* `/today` quick-nav → **`/customers`** (the back-office master) — but the operational pick is **`/field/van-sales/customers`** (the Today JP / All-Customers picker). Two different "Customers".
   - *Inventory:* `/today` quick-nav → **`/inventory`** (warehouse view) vs. the bottom-nav + hub → **`/field/stock`** (van stock). Two different "Inventory".
   - *Selling / invoices:* `/today` quick-nav → **`/sales/invoices`** (the generic back-office editor the FMCG salesman role was deliberately cleaned away from) vs. the canonical **`/field/van-sales/sell`**.
3. **Route entry is split.** "Start Journey" lives on `/today`; the visit-driven route + the operational tiles live on `/field/van-sales`. The single Route → Visit → Sell loop is reached from two places.
4. **Bottom nav reinforces the split.** The salesman's tabs are Home (`/dashboard`), **Today** (`/today`), Sell, Inventory — so "Today" is the advertised home, yet the actual operational workspace is the *other* hub.

Net: the operational path you defined — **Customer → Statement → Collect → Sell →
Return → Print → End Day** — exists, but its front door is duplicated and its
quick-links point at back-office screens.

---

## 2. What should remain

- **The operational spine + deep routes** (unchanged): the visit-driven route, the
  customer picker (Today JP / All Customers), the customer statement = visit
  context, and Collect / Sell / Return / Print, plus End Day & Settle, van
  reconciliation, and the governed reopen workflow. These are correct and stay.
- **The day lifecycle** (`erp_work_sessions`: not_started → open → closed, the
  day-close guard, reopen) — the single source of "where am I in the day".
- **The genuinely useful "Today" signals** — coverage %, overdue, attention /
  next-best-action. These are valuable; they should **move into** the one
  workspace as a compact header, not justify a second home.
- **A lighter `/today` for non-salesman field roles** (admin / manager /
  supervisor also land on `/today`). The merge must stay **role-aware** so they
  are not forced into a van workspace.

---

## 3. What should be merged

**Collapse the two homes into one.** Per your direction, **`/today` becomes the
primary salesman workspace** and **absorbs** the Van-Sales "My Day" hub for a van
salesman:

- `/today` (for a van salesman) renders the **day status + single primary CTA**
  (Start Day → Continue Route → End Day & Settle), the **route-first entry**, the
  **operational tiles** (Customer, Van Stock, Returns…), the **reopen** state, and
  the **signals** header — i.e. exactly what `/field/van-sales` shows today, plus
  the Today stats.
- **Retire `/field/van-sales` as a separate destination:** redirect it to
  `/today` (keep the route alive so existing links/bookmarks don't 404).
- **Remove the circular link:** "Start Day" no longer points to `/today` (it *is*
  `/today`); it just opens the day in place.
- **De-duplicate the quick-nav destinations** so each operational task has ONE
  home: Customers → the **picker** (`/field/van-sales/customers`), not `/customers`
  master; Inventory → **van stock** (`/field/stock`), not `/inventory`; drop
  `/sales/invoices` from the salesman's field home (already role-gated away).

What is **not** merged: the back-office screens themselves (`/customers`,
`/sales/invoices`, `/inventory`) remain for the roles that own them — they simply
stop being surfaced as the salesman's field shortcuts.

---

## 4. Navigation impact

| Element | Today | After merge |
|---|---|---|
| Bottom-nav **Today** tab → `/today` | a stats home that links out to the real hub | **the** salesman workspace (route + tiles + day + signals) |
| `/field/van-sales` | second day-home | **redirects to `/today`** (alias; no 404) |
| Van-Sales hub **Start Day** → `/today` | circular | gone — opens the day in place |
| `/today` quick-nav **Customers** → `/customers` | back-office master | **`/field/van-sales/customers`** (picker) |
| `/today` quick-nav **Inventory** → `/inventory` | warehouse | **`/field/stock`** (van stock) |
| `/today` quick-nav **Invoices** → `/sales/invoices` | back-office editor | **removed** for the field salesman |
| Bottom-nav **Sell** / **Inventory** | `/field/van-sales/sell` · `/field/stock` | unchanged (step shortcuts into the one workspace) |
| **Home** `/dashboard` tab | generic dashboard | (optional) for a pure van salesman this is redundant with the workspace — candidate to drop from the salesman's bottom nav so Today is unambiguously home |

Result: **one** Customers, **one** Inventory, **one** Sell, **one** day home — no
duplicate path to the same operational task.

## 5. Migration strategy

Reuse-first, flag-gated, pilot-first, reversible — the same playbook as the
visit-driven route and day-reopen work:

1. **Flag:** `platform.unified_salesman_workspace` (default OFF). When ON for a
   company AND the user is a van salesman (`field.sales` + Van Sales active),
   `/today` composes the unified workspace; otherwise the current `/today` and
   `/field/van-sales` are untouched.
2. **Compose, don't rebuild:** `/today` reuses the existing pieces — the hub's
   `STEPS` spine + day-status (`loadVanDayState`), the visit-driven route entry,
   the reopen gate, and the existing Today signal widgets. No new engine.
3. **Alias the old hub:** `/field/van-sales` → redirect to `/today` (flag-gated),
   so every existing link, bookmark, and the "Start Day" target resolve to the one
   workspace.
4. **Fix the quick-nav destinations** (Customers/Inventory/Invoices) behind the
   same flag.
5. **Validate on the pilot**, then **promote to the FMCG default** (same
   mechanism as the reopen design's Appendix B: business-type default-on at
   company creation; existing companies via an opt-in migrator; non-FMCG
   verticals unaffected).
6. **Rollback:** flip the flag OFF → both surfaces revert exactly as today; the
   redirect and quick-nav changes are all flag-gated and additive.

Non-salesman field roles keep the lighter `/today`; the unified composition only
applies to van salesmen, so managers/supervisors are unaffected.

---

## 6. Recommended final salesman experience

**One workspace at `/today`:**

```
┌── Today (the only home) ─────────────────────────────┐
│  Day status: ● Open    [ End Day & Settle ]          │  ← single day CTA
│  Coverage 72% · Overdue 3 · Attention 5              │  ← compact signals
│                                                      │
│  ▶ Continue route — next: Customer 7/18              │  ← route-first primary
│                                                      │
│  Quick:  [Customer] [Van Stock] [Returns]            │  ← off-plan / secondary
│  (Reopen request banner if the day is closed)        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Route-first:** the visit-driven route is the spine. "Continue route" → next
  stop → **customer visit context** (Statement → Collect / Sell / Return / Print →
  Complete Visit → Next). Off-plan selling uses the **Customer** tile (Today JP /
  All Customers picker).
- **One day CTA** that reflects state: *Start Day* → *Continue Route* → *End Day &
  Settle*; reopen request surfaces when closed.
- **Signals** (coverage / overdue / attention) as a header, not a second screen.
- **Bottom nav:** Today (home/workspace) · Sell · Inventory (van stock) ·
  Approvals (supervisors only) · More. No duplicate entry points.

**Outcome:** one salesman workspace, one customer journey, one operational
workflow, zero duplicate entry points — and it slots directly onto the unified
FMCG lifecycle already documented (Open Day → … → End Day → Settlement → …).

---

## 7. Decision (confirmed)

**`/today` is the canonical salesman workspace; `/field/van-sales` redirects into
it.** Operational functionality moves into `/today`; no second home. The
experience is **visit-driven and customer-driven**, and the salesman is never
asked to pick a "module". Proceed on go-ahead, behind
`platform.unified_salesman_workspace`, pilot-first.

---

# 8. Final recommendation & implementation-ready migration plan

The whole change is **composition + redirect + de-dup** over existing, shipped
components — **no new engine, no schema, no transaction change.** Everything is
gated by one flag and is reversible.

## 8.1 The one workspace (`/today`, van salesman, flag ON)
A single role-aware page that **reuses** what already exists:

| Block | Reused from |
|---|---|
| Day status + single CTA (Start Day → Continue Route → End Day & Settle) | `loadVanDayState` + the hub's CTA (`field/van-sales/page.tsx`) |
| Route-first entry (the visit spine) | visit-driven route (`/field/journey` + `visit-session`) |
| Operational tiles (Customer picker · Van Stock · Returns · Reconcile) | the hub `STEPS` array (filtered) |
| Reopen banner / request when closed | `loadDayReopenGate` + `DayClosedGate`/reopen form |
| Signals header (coverage · overdue · attention) | `homeSignals` + `nextBestActions` (already on `/today`) |

The target loop is exactly your sequence — **Today → Route → Customer → Statement
→ Collect → Sell → Return → Print → Complete Visit → Next Customer → End Day** —
with the route as the primary entry and the customer statement as the visit
context (both already built).

## 8.2 Concrete changes (file-level, all flag-gated)
1. **Flag:** add `platform.unified_salesman_workspace` to `feature-catalog.ts`
   (`P(..., [])`, default OFF) + i18n in `features.ts`; helper
   `unifiedSalesmanWorkspaceEnabled(flags)` in `van-sales/sell.ts`.
2. **Compose `/today`** (`today/page.tsx`): when the flag is ON **and** the user
   is a van salesman (`field.sales` + Van Sales active), render the unified
   workspace (the blocks in 8.1). Otherwise the current `/today` is unchanged
   (managers/supervisors keep the lighter home).
3. **Redirect the old hub** (`field/van-sales/page.tsx`): same condition →
   `redirect('/today')`. Keep the hub for non-flagged tenants / non-salesman.
4. **Kill the circular link:** the "Start Day" CTA opens the day **in place**
   (existing day-open / journey check-in), never links to `/today` (it *is*
   `/today`).
5. **De-dup the quick-nav destinations** (`today/page.tsx`, behind the flag):
   Customers → `/field/van-sales/customers` (picker); Inventory → `/field/stock`
   (van stock); **remove** `/sales/invoices` and the separate `/field/van-sales`
   link for the field salesman.
6. **Bottom nav:** Today tab unchanged (`/today` is now the workspace). *Optional*
   — drop the `/dashboard` "Home" tab for a pure van salesman so Today is
   unambiguously the only home (small change in `bottom-nav-tabs.ts`, can defer).

## 8.3 Phases
- **Phase 1 (pilot, flag OFF by default):** steps 1–5 above; enable the flag for
  the pilot only. Reuse-only; no engine/schema/transaction change.
- **Phase 2:** UAT the full loop (Today → Route → … → End Day & Settle) on the
  pilot; refine spacing/copy; optional bottom-nav simplification (step 6).
- **Phase 3 (post-validation):** promote to the **FMCG default** — business-type
  default-on at company creation (parallel to `erp_seed_company_roles`), existing
  companies via an **opt-in migrator**, non-FMCG verticals untouched (identical
  mechanism to the day-reopen Appendix B).

## 8.4 Risks & mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `/today` is shared with managers/supervisors | Compose the workspace **only** for van salesmen (`field.sales` + Van Sales active); others keep today's `/today`. |
| Redirect loop (`/field/van-sales` ↔ `/today`) | One-way redirect, flag- + role-gated; `/today` never redirects back. |
| Deep links / bookmarks to `/field/van-sales/*` | Only the **hub index** redirects; the deep routes (`/sell`, `/collect`, `/return`, `/statement`, `/customers`, `/reopen-approvals`) stay where they are. |
| Non-FMCG / non-van tenants | Flag default OFF + role/van gating → zero change for them. |
| Regression in the existing Today signals | Signals are reused as-is; the compose only adds the operational blocks. |

## 8.5 Rollback
Flip `platform.unified_salesman_workspace` OFF → `/today` and `/field/van-sales`
revert exactly as today, the redirect and quick-nav changes disappear. All changes
are additive and flag-gated; no data or schema involved.

## 8.6 Definition of done (Phase 1)
- A van salesman opening the app lands on **one** home (`/today`) that drives the
  whole day; `/field/van-sales` redirects in; there is exactly **one** Customers
  (picker), **one** Inventory (van stock), **one** Sell (van-sell), and **one**
  day CTA. tsc + tests + build green; pilot flag enabled; UAT script for the full
  Today → Route → … → End Day loop.

# 9. Next refinement pass (approved direction — queued, NOT yet implemented)

Captured during pilot UAT of the unified workspace. The unified direction is
approved; these are batched for the next pass so the current UAT build stays
stable. Reuse-only, no engine/schema/transaction change.

1. **Customer = primary operational entry point.** Keep the canonical sequence as
   the primary workflow: **Customer → Statement → Collect → Sell → Return → Print
   → Complete Visit → Next Customer**. The route remains the spine ("Continue
   route" stays), but make **Customer** the lead entry (first tile / primary
   affordance) rather than route-first.
2. **Tile order** (match the real visit flow):
   `Customer · Collect · Sell · Return · Van Stock · End Day & Settle`
   (promote End Day & Settle into the tile grid).
3. **Operational KPIs in the top section** (explicitly a future pass, not a UAT
   blocker) — all sourceable from existing data, reuse-only:
   | KPI | Source (already available) |
   |---|---|
   | Planned customers | `erp_today_journey(salesman, today)` |
   | Visited customers | `erp_visits` (today, this session/salesman) |
   | Remaining customers | planned − visited |
   | Today's sales | today's invoices (`created_by`=rep) net total |
   | Today's collections | today's `erp_collections` / allocations for the rep |
   | Route compliance % | coverage (visited ÷ planned) — `homeSignals.coveragePct` |

Status: queued for implementation on the user's signal after UAT.
